    <h3 align="center">Welcome to MR Government Arts College<br><hr>

        The rural and underprivileged people of Mannargudi region found it difficult to pursue higher education as there was no college in this area. So, a few good people whoe were interested in social welfare decided to found a college in Mannargudi. Many philanthropists of this area helped establish a college and thereby educate the youth of this rural and underdeveloped area.
        <br>
              A committee was formed to collect fund to achieve the end of founding a government college in Mannargudi. While the District Collector of Tanjore presided over the Comkittee, The Revenue Divisional Officer was its Secretary and Mr. T.G. Chandrasekaran Chettiyar was its Treasurer. Many philanthropists, religious and other organisations of Mannargudi and its nearby places helped enormously to construct the college building. The notable ones of them are:
